# Project Setup
For this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly
If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the src directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project.git
```

Install missing dependencies using rosdep install:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
```

If you haven’t already, following line can be added to your .bashrc to auto-source all new terminals
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To launch the project:
```sh
$ roslaunch pr2_robot pick_place_project.launch
```

In a different terminal, run:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/scripts/
$ ./object_detection.py
```
